  Goal of humans vs goals of AI.
  Moa extingisued because we had differen goal and we humans were smarter.
  But AI will  be smarter that us. So we should not have opposite goals. Otherwise we might end up like the Moas.

  Why do we do this AI thing in the first place? Because of curiosity and economics.


  Should we stop working on AI because of all of the bad consequence it can have?
  No. Because then it's just a matter of time when we get killed by an astroid, by climate change, disease.


  We still have time. To get the rules right, so that AI is a tool that makes the world a better place. And not a tool that does harm to people.

  So what can you do? Like Neo in Matrix you can take the blue pill of the red pill. You can ignore, that means you hope it will tun out OK. But if you hope you are not in control. Your are passive. If want to be active, and shape the future in whatever way, then you have to take your responsibily. And I think you did alreadym, by showing up here, and want to learn something about AI.





  2 Examples of AI in action:
  - positive: loking at social media comments an AI could predict the risk of depresseiosn month before it actualkly happens with pretty good accurarany.
  - negative: researches found on google women are less likely to see job ads for high paying jobs.

  Conclusion: It will not get more object. Decission will be more subjecting, and that is accourding to the goals, that are set up for this system.


  Conflicting goals




  AI as a tool.
