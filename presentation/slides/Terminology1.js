traditional progamming vs machine learning

  traditional progamming is like a recipe, give the computer a list of instruction to execute. E.g. if water is too hot, do this. After 5 mins do that. You set up rules.

  machine learning is learning by anaylizing data. The more data you give the AI for training the better the system gets. Thatâ€™s intelligence.


"The concept of AI is based on the idea of building machines capable of thinking, acting, and learning like humans."
