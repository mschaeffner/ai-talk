Conflicting goals



Depends if this is our goal. If want that to happen.

Goal of humans vs goals of AI.


Moa extingisued because we had differen goal and we humans were smarter.

But AI will be smarter that us. So we should not have opposite goals. Otherwise we might end up like the Moas.


Why do we do this AI thing in the first place? Because of curiosity and economics.




Conclusion: It will not get more object. Decission will be more subjecting, and that is accourding to the goals, that are set up for this system.
  Example about hiring people.









Should we stop working on AI because of all of the bad consequence it can have?
No. Because then it's just a matter of time when we get killed by an astroid, by climate change, disease.

We still have time. To get the rules right, so that AI is a tool that makes the world a better place. And not a tool that does harm to people.
So what can you do? Like Neo in Matrix you can take the blue pill of the red pill. You can ignore, that means you hope it will tun out OK. But if you hope you are not in control. Your are passive. If want to be active, and shape the future in whatever way, then you have to take your responsibily. And I think you did alreadym, by showing up here, and want to learn something about AI.










When we llok back, we always think technological advanvement is. Nobody wants to give away the smartphone. Nobody want sto gid rid of cars and use horses again. Nobody wants to live in cages again.

But we dont apply the same logic to the future. We scared of change. But once it happened, we are happy that it happened.

Almost everything you like to have today was invented in the last 200 years. Your phone, your tv, your shoes. Your car.





We are failing to have an appropriate emotional response.



"Stuart Russell has a nice analogy here," he shares.
"He said, imagine that we received a message from an alien civilization, which read:
'People of Earth, we will arrive on your planet in 50 years. Get ready.' And now, we're just counting down the
months until the mothership lands? We would feel a little more urgency than we do."



Stuart Russell, a computer scientist
If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, We'll arrive in a few decades," would we just reply,
"OK, call us when you get here – we'll leave the lights on"? Probably not – but this is more or less what is happening with AI.
