Will automation make us unemployed? We dont have no jobs anymore?

Automation happens constantly.
for the ast 200 years since industrial revolution

Industrial revolution, first machine, made us humans stronger, and we created new types of jobs, and we got wealthier. Before we were all farmers.
Creative jobs. We can be super creative. It will incresse value of socierty.

Their is not so much andavancemnt in AI getting creating, or thinking outside of the box.



And tech kills jobs, even entire industries. E.g. "1 2 3"

New industris arise, new jobs created. And we can even image what will come.
The point is that the new jobs are general beter than the old ones. Save, more engaging, paid more. Examples.




Half of jobs in economy are kind of repetitive and can be automated with AI.
That will put large stress on society.


Better to understand what AI is going to in future.
That not only low payed jobs. Also accounts, finanacial analysts, journalists, laywer, doctors.

Jobs that are not future prove because they are very likelike to be replaced by AI systems.

  1) financial analyst, most financial transactions are made by machines already
  2) taxi drivers. self driving cars already drive dafeer then humand beings. now it's just a metter of regulations to get them started.
  3) journalists, laywer, doctors. (AI can detect skin cancer already better then doctors)

  - positive: loking at social media comments an AI could predict the risk of depresseiosn month before it actualkly happens with pretty good accurarany.




There haven't been any progress that AI is creative / creativity. // emotional
Creative jobs. We can be super creative. It will incresse value of socierty.


If you do something today, and you get better the more data you have. the more likely an AI will do it the future.
Nobody can look over a dateset of 100 biollion data points. A computer can nowadays.
